## Disable

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/disable.md.erb" %>

Send a Disable request whenever a device is no longer required.
This request cancels a previously executed Enable request and 
prevents the return of data from the device_ID specified.  
It does not release the peripheral if the Release bool is set to False.  
If the peripheral is not disabled, this request will disable the peripheral. 

### HTTP Request
