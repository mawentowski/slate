## Request Bearer Token

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/getbearertoken.md.erb" %>

Request a bearer token to establish authorization to use our API. Enter the credentials we 
provided you as part of signup in the header of your request, as shown below.

### HTTP Request

`POST /oauth2/token`

### Header Parameters
<!-- Is it assumed header parameters are mandatory, or need to say explicity? -->
<!-- Maybe explain M/O since it is abbreviated -->
<!-- Min and max values are really only applicable to non-variable fields. How handle? -->

content_type | application/x-www-<br>form-urlencoded | string | The format the body of the request is being sent as.
client_ID | {{client_ID}} | string | The public identifier for your application represented as a 32-character hex string.
client_secret | {{client_secret}} | string | The secret (or password) known only to the application and the authorization server.
resource_ID | {{resource_ID}} | string | The fully qualified ID of the resource your application is requesting "access to". 
AAD_instance | {{AAD_instance}} | string | Your dedicated and trusted instance of Azure Active Directory.

### Request Body
Since the content_type for this request is **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**, there is no JSON example. Below is a request example:

`content_type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded&client_ID={{client_ID}}&client_secret={{client_secret}}&resource_ID={{resource_ID}}&AAD_instance={{AAD_instance}}`

Param | Value | Type | Description
------|-------|------|------------
grant_type | client_credentials | string | Credentials granting you limited access to our resources in order to request an access token.
client_ID | {{client_ID}} | string | The public identifier for your application represented as a 32-character hex string.
client_secret | {{client_secret}} | string | The secret (or password) known only to the application and the authorization server.
resource_ID | {{resource_ID}} | string | The fully qualified ID of the resource your application is requesting "access to". 

<aside class="success">
A successful request returns a 200 OK Status with the body returning the bearer token. OAuth2 is now 
established.
</aside>

### Response

Param | Type | O/M | Description
------|------|-----|------------
token_type | string | Mandatory | The type of token (i.e. Bearer).
expires_in | datetime | Mandatory | The date and time the access token expires.
resource_ID | string | Mandatory | The fully qualified ID of the resource your application is requesting "access to". 
access_token | string | Mandatory | Token that informs the API that you are authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.


Now that OAuth2 is established, use the bearer token to retrieve a session token. 
Please note that the bearer token expires, as indicated by the `expires_in` value returned in the response.

Use a tool such as [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to view the content of the bearer token. This approach is handy for troubleshooting 
if you need to verify permission roles granted for the client it is provided against.
