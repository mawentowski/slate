## Set up account

You need a **developer**, **personal**, or **business account** to log into our **developer portal**, gain credentials, and create an API test environment.
Each account provides different levels of access to **SmartInventory** functionality.

Capabilities | Developer | Personal | Business 
-------------|-----------|----------|---------
Access test environment | x | x | x |
Make API requests | | x | x |
Go live | | | x |

If you would like to access a capability you currently do not have, you may upgrade your account on your **Account** page in the **Developer portal**.
