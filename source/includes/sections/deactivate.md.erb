## Deactivate

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/deactivate.md.erb" %>

Send a deactivate request whenever a device is no longer required.
This request cancels a previously executed activate request and 
prevents the return of data from the device_ID specified.  
It does not release the device if the Release bool is set to False.  
If the device is not deactivated, this request will deactivate the device.
