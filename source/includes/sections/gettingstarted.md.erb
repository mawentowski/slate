Our web-hosted resources are protected through the Microsoft identity platform that 
implements [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization protocol. 
OAuth 2.0 is a method through which your third-party app can access web-hosted 
resources on behalf of your users.

Before you integrate our IoT API, your application must establish authorization 
via the Microsoft identity platform's 
OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to access our API.
