Overview

The Peripheral IoT API allows you to build applications that use customers’ mobile devices as data interfaces.

Getting Started

Our web-hosted resources are protected through 
the Microsoft identity platform that implements OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. 
OAuth 2.0 is a method through which your third-party app can access web-hosted 
resources on behalf of your users.

Before you integrate our IoT API, your application must establish authorization 
via the Microsoft identity platform's 
OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to access our API. To do so, you must include 
the bearer token retrieved by a GetBearerToken request in the header of all your requests.
