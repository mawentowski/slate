## Enable

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/enable.md.erb" %>

Enable a peripheral for reading or scanning.

Enabling a peripheral indicates that the application is ready to receive data via the messages.

Executing a Disable request will stop the flow of data to the application.

There is no need to explicitly acquire the device before this command is issued, but in this case the ExclusiveAccess flag will be set to True by default.

The application should disable the device when it receives an AccessExpiry message with a ‘AccessRequested’ parameter.  And should disable the device when not in use.
