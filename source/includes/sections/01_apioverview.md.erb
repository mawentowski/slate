## What is SmartInventory?
The **SmartInventory API** lets you create inventory management applications that use IoT-enabled devices 
(i.e. barcode scanners and printers) to collect data from scan events in warehouses to track products
as they move through stocking to shipping.

## Who is it for?
Developers creating applications for warehouse management that track stock levels, forecast sales, identify gaps
in quality control, and create audits. You can also issue commands to devices using our API to do things like
print physical copies of crew reports in the warehouse or change settings in a scanner.

## Why use it?
Our API manages the interaction between *your customers'* warehouse devices and *your* applications, so you do not need to reinvent the wheel.
In the end, that means saving costs and cutting down on your development time so you can turn a profit sooner
than later.

## How do I use it?
After you have completed sign up and registeration, we provide you the credentials you need to request
access to our API. You can then start to enroll your devices at a warehouse area,
activate them for data capture, send them commands to perform certain actions, and request
device statuses to ensure they are working. This doc site was creating to walk you through entire process
of using our API!
