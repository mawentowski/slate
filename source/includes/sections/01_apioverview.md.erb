Welcome to the SmartInventory API! Our API lets you create inventory tracking apps that allow 
workers to control IoT-enabled devices (i.e. barcode scanners and printers) so the devices can collect data
for analysis by your application. You can then use the data to create customized inventory reports for
warehouse manager to report things such as loss, for example.

How does it work?
After you have completed sign up and registeration, we provide you the credentials you need to request
access to our API. You can then start to subscribe your devices to a data location,
enable them for data capture, send them commands to perform certain actions, and request
device statuses to ensure they are working. This doc site was creating to walk you through entire process
of using our API!
