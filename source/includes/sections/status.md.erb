## Status

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/status.md.erb" %>

Request the status of peripherals.  

This is an information command and the status will still be returned even if the peripheral is acquired for exclusive access by another application. If the status of all peripherals is desired, leave the LocatorList empty.

### HTTP Request

`POST location/status`

### Request Body
For the sake of exercising the API, you can specify any numerical value as the transaction ID and view it via the subscription.

Param | Type | O/M | Description
------|------|-----|------------
LocatorList | string | Mandatory | Retrieves the real-time status of the peripherals identified in the LocatorList.
TransactionId | string | Optional | The TransactionId used by the application.
SessionToken | string | Optional | The SessionToken received from the previously executed Subscribe request.

<aside class="success">
A successful request returns a status of 200 OK and the status message will either be sent to 1) the endpoint defined by the return payload from the Subscribe request for the specified location, or 2) to the service bus. The second scenario occurs when a webhook was not specified in the previously executed Subscribe request.
