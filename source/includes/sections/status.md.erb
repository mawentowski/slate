## Status

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/status.md.erb" %>

Request the status of peripherals.  

This is an information command and the status will still be returned even if the peripheral is acquired for exclusive access by another application. If the status of all peripherals is desired, leave the LocatorList empty.

### HTTP Request

`POST location/status`

### Request Body
For the sake of exercising the API, you can specify any numerical value as the transaction ID and view it via the subscription.

Param | Type | O/M | Description
------|------|-----|------------
LocatorList | string | Mandatory | A list comprised of one or more devices.
TransactionId | string | Optional | The transaction initiated through an API call from your application.
SessionToken | string | Mandatory | One-time bearer token used to establish a session for a user and is revoked when the token expires. It contains the location at which the session token will be used.

<aside class="success">
A successful request returns a status of 200 OK and the status message will either be sent to 1) the endpoint defined by the return payload from the Subscribe request for the specified location, or 2) to the service bus. The second scenario occurs when a webhook was not specified in the previously executed Subscribe request.
