## Activate

<%= partial "includes/codesnippets/activate.md.erb" %>

Activate a device for scanning or printing. Activating a device indicates that the device can now send
data to your application via messages. For example, an activated device can send scan events to your application,
or you may send a command to an activated printer to print a crew report. Deactivating a device will stop it from sending data.
